# Telepass-Simulation
This is a program written in Java which simulates the Telepass system. It was made as part of the "Programming 3" exam at the University of Naples "Parthenope".

The program was written on a GNU/Linux machine, using VSCode and Open JDK 15. It includes the JDBC driver for SQLite under the folder /lib. It uses Java Swing for the UI.

The program can be accessed as a normal user (vehicle) or as a supervisor. The core of this project is to provide good examples of "Command", "Builder" and "Singleton" design patterns.

Compile and run.
